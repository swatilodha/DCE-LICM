# LLVM Dataflow Pass for evaluating Dominators

This implementation generates a Dominator Map, with the following key-value specification:

key = BasicBlock Name  
value = Set of names of Dominators for the key

This map can be accessed by adding this pass to your custom LLVM pass, and accessing it through the following API:
`getAnalysis<Dominators>().getDomMap()`

To build the Dominators pass, run:
```
make clean
make
```

To run tests:
```
make run-dom-1
make run-dom-2
```

To run your custom tests:
```
opt -enable-new-pm=0 -load=./dominators.so -dominators <path-to-test-file-bitcode> -o /dev/null
```
