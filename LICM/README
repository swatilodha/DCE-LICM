# Loop Invariant Code Motion Pass

This directory implemented two Loop Passes :

1. Landing Pad Transformation Pass - Similar to the loop-rotate pass in LLVM
2. Loop Invariant Code Motion Pass - Similar to the licm pass in LLVM

The loop invariant code motion pass assumes that its input is already modified by 
the landing pad transformation pass, therefore, they must be executed in order.

To build the passes, run:
 ```
 make clean  
 make
 ```

To run the tests:
 ```
 make run-licm-1
 make run-licm-2
 make run-licm-3
 ```

To test against custom input, run:
```
opt -enable-new-pm=0 -load=./licm.so -loop-invariant-code-motion <path-to-input-file> -o <path-to-output-file>
```
